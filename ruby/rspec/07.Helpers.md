Sometimes your RSpec examples need an easy way to share reusable code. The best way to accomplish this is with Helpers.
Helpers are basically regular Ruby methods which you share across examples. 

```
describe User, '#display_name' do
  it 'displays its admin capabilities in its name when an admin' do
    user = build_user name: 'John Doe', admin: true
    expect(user.display_name).to eq 'John Doe (admin)'
  end

  it 'displays no additional data when not an admin' do
    user = build_user name: 'John Doe', admin: false
    expect(user.display_name).to eq 'John Doe'
  end

  def build_user(options)
    User.new(options)
  end
end
```
