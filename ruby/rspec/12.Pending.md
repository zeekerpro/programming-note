You can write "unimplemented" or "do later examples".

ex:
```
@1 example, 0 failures, 1 pending@
```

Here's how to write them:

```
it "does something" # no block
```
 or

```
it "does something" do
  pending "an announcement"
  # any code after the pending statement will not be run
end
```
or

```
it "does something" do
  pending "an announcement" do
    # any code in this block *will* be run
    # - if it fails or raises, it will be reported as pending
    # - if it runs without a problem, it will be reported as a failure
    #    with a message indicating that you have a pending example
    #    that no longer needs to be pending
  end
end
```
