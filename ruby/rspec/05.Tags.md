RSpec Tags provide an easy way to run specific tests in your spec files. By default, RSpec will run all tests in the spec files that it runs, but you might only need to run a subset of them. 

```
describe "How to run specific Examples with Tags" do
   it 'is a slow test', :slow = > true do
      sleep 10
      puts 'This test is slow!'
   end

   it 'is a fast test', :fast = > true do
      puts 'This test is fast!'
   end
end
```

```
bundle exec rspec --tag/-t slow tag_spec.rb

This test is slow
```

同理，tag可以打在 context 和 describe 关键字上
